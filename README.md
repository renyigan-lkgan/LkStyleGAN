# LkStyleGAN

Please clone the official StyleGAN code at `https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan` and replace the `train.py` and `training/loss.py` with 
the files in this repository to run LkStyleGAN. 
You can control the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; parameters in the `train.py` file and add simplified gradient penalty in 
`training/loss.py`.
